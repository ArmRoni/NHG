                    <p>As Singapore moves towards endemic COVID-19, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) remains a crucial vanguard in this transition, working closely with the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), the Ministry of Health (MOH), community partners, and the public to manage COVID-19 cases in the community. In tandem with battling COVID-19, TTSH continues to forge ahead in transforming care for residents in the Central Region of Singapore. Its strong relationships with health and social partners, culture of continuous learning and innovation, as well as sustained emphasis on collective leadership, have been instrumental in building a ‘Community of Care’ to achieve better population health outcomes for a Healthier SG. </p>
                    <h4> TRANSITING TO ENDEMIC COVID-19</h4>
                    <p>TTSH-Renci Subacute Treatment Facility For Stable COVID-19 Patients
                        To support the nation’s COVID-19 response efforts, TTSH opened its own subacute COVID-19 Treatment Facility (CTF) at Ren Ci Hospital in November 2021, with the support of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), NHG HQ, National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGP), National Skin Centre (NSC), and private medical agencies. 
                    </p>

                    <p>The TTSH CTF cared for COVID-19 patients who had recovered from the acute phase of their infection, but still required longer-term close monitoring. This facilitated the right-siting of patients and eased the patient load at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), TTSH and other hospitals, allowing healthcare staff to better manage patients with more serious illnesses needing specialised acute and critical ICU care. Patients at TTSH CTF received therapy treatments, which focused on helping them regain their functional abilities by improving their strength and nutrition through close monitoring of their condition, and reconciling their follow-up appointments upon discharge and referrals to day rehabilitation and home nursing services, if needed. The CTF cared for over 400 patients between November 2021 and April 2022.</p>

                    <h4> DRIVING BETTER POPULATION HEALTH</h4>
                    <strong> Official Opening of Ang Mo Kio Specialist Centre  </strong>


                   <p> In March 2022, TTSH officially opened the Ang Mo Kio Specialist Centre (AMKSC), bringing affordable healthcare closer to the community. The event was graced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as Guest-of-Honour. To make healthcare more accessible to residents, AMKSC partnered with the General Practitioners (GPs), polyclinics and community partners to design and develop new services and models of care. These allow patients to seek treatment for specific conditions closer to home, while enabling more timely identification and management of potentially serious issues. </p> 
                   <p>The suite of specialist care and services provided includes:  </p>

                  <strong> Trans-disciplinary diabetes care  </strong>
                    <p> Patients with diabetes are seen by specially trained Clinical Diabetes Educators (CDE), who provide more holistic diabetes care education and advice, reducing cost and the number of clinic visits for patients while improving compliance and outcomes.</p>

                    <strong> Community Eye Clinic</strong>
                    <p>Patients with chronic eye conditions such as blurring of vision, suspected glaucoma, and who require post-cataract surgery follow-up are reviewed by optometrists, enabling faster access to care near their homes.  </p>

                    <strong>Community Hearing Evaluation  </strong>
                    <p> Audiologists provide basic hearing examinations, and hearing aid interventions, which allow more residents to be screened in the community, and facilitate more timely identification and management of hearing-related issues.</p>


                    <strong>Integrated musculoskeletal care services  </strong>
                    <p>

                    <h4> Official Opening of Clinic for Advanced Rehabilitation Therapeutics </h4>

                    <p> 
                    In April 2022, the TTSH Clinic for Advanced Rehabilitation Therapeutics (CART) celebrated its 10th Anniversary and expanded premises, which was graced by Minister for Health Mr Ong Ye Kung. CART offers conventional therapy equipment and state-of-the-art rehabilitative robots to meet the growing demand for such services, helping patients with stroke, brain, and spinal cord injuries in their recovery journey. With its newly expanded premises, CART now offers therapy for those with neurodegenerative disorders and patients recovering from multiple serious injuries.
                    </p> 

                    <p>To enable more patients to gain greater access to innovative technology-enabled rehabilitation, CART inked partnerships with leading rehabilitation care partners: </p> 

                    <p>•   Through a three-year Master Research Collaboration Agreement (RCA) with Fourier Intelligence (FI), CART will make robotic therapies more accessible to patients in the community and will function as a living lab to test-bed and contextualise FI’s technologies to local settings. </p>

                    <p> •   Through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Stroke Support Station (S3), TTSH will refer stable stroke patients to S3 for continued active rehabilitation, wellness activities, and access to a peer support network. This shared care model will allow S3 and TTSH to better co-manage stroke survivors and ensure continued support through their rehabilitative journey. They will also explore tele-collaboration and tele-consultation services.</p>

                    <strong> “What matters to you” Workshop Series </strong>
                    <p> 
                        To reach out to partners in the community, TTSH’s Psychology Department collaborated with the Agency for Integrated Care’s (AIC) Silver Generation Division in July 2021 to launch the “What Matters to you” workshop series, which focused on how to conduct meaningful conversations with seniors on their priorities and engaging them to motivate and influence behavioural change to achieve better health and social outcomes. These workshops used a person-centred approach and leveraged relationship-based care to help seniors lead meaningful and fulfilling lives. Four workshops were conducted for AIC’s Silver Generation Officers (SGOs), and each workshop comprised two half-day sessions. Over 100 SGOs attended the training, and they have since trained other SGOs, and incorporated ‘What Matters’ conversations in the preventive health visits they conduct.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        Together with the Centre for Allied Health & Pharmacy Excellence (CAPE), the Psychology Department also conducted four workshops to train TTSH staff from various disciplines, including the Division of Central Health’s Community Health Team, allied health, nursing, pharmacists, and medical teams, to incorporate “What Matters” conversations into care encounters.

                   <strong>Powering Up People, Charging Up Lives </strong>  

                  <p>TTSH’s Centre of Health Activation (CHA) launched the CHArge Up! Learning Programme in October 2018 to meet the health needs of the local neighbourhoods in Central Singapore. The programme aims to empower carers (patients, caregivers, volunteers, and residents) with the health skills, knowledge and confidence to take charge of their health and, in turn, look after the health of others in the community. </p>

                   <p> To adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic and safe management measures, the programme adopted digital learning in 2020 and conducted virtual sessions to teach carers proper handling of a wheelchair, chronic disease management and staying active. Continual improvements to the programme are made through research evaluation studies and developing new modules. In collaboration with 33 different partners, CHArge Up! has trained over 490 carers to-date, and plans to further expand across the Central Region. </p>

                <strong>Engaging Residents To Build Healthier Communities </strong>

               <P> In May 2022, TTSH’s Centre for Health Activation (CHA) and Kaizen Office engaged residents in Ang Mo Kio for guerilla research, the first session in two years since the COVID-19 pandemic. Themed “Building Healthier Communities”, the research kick-started a year-long quality improvement project aimed at strengthening the community-enabling programmes, aligned with Healthier SG. Residents were invited to identify and discuss specific factors affecting community health and how the community could help shape individual health. The session also raised greater awareness and understanding among the local population of the correlation between individuals and the community in health and social care. The valuable insights gained from the residents will help improve TTSH’s outreach programmes and co-create localised, community-driven solutions, making them more impactful, scalable, and sustainable in the community.</P>

                <p> In recognition of the pivotal roles that volunteers play in supporting the healthcare workforce and the recovery journey of patients, TTSH’s Centre for Health Activation (CHA) organised the annual TTSH & Central Health Volunteer Appreciation Party (VAP) in March 2022. Held virtually, the event appreciated and celebrated the accomplishments of over 100 volunteers and community partners.
