                    <p>COVID-19 tested the public healthcare system to its maximum and collectively with the Government, agencies, partners, and citizens, we have reduced the crisis from a pandemic to an endemic state. Every one of you deserves a big “Thank you”.</p>

                    <p>Although life now has a good semblance of normalcy, the virus still hovers at over 2,000 reported cases daily, and is unlikely to be stamped out for good. In fact, we can expect the virus to mutate and circulate longer with land, air, and sea travel now open. Its new variants of concern (VOC), such as Delta and Omicron, and multiple waves of infections past, present, and future will continue to keep us busy. Singapore with its high vaccination rate has managed to be in a stable state, and most aspects of life have returned to pre-COVID level. Social restrictions have been lifted except for public transport and visits to hospitals, and the flights for overseas work and vacation have increased with a new buzz of hope. </p>

                    <p>For us in healthcare, our deep involvement on the frontline for more than two years, has left scars of the COVID battle. Even so, with fortitude, resilience, and encouragement from the public and the world, we stand ready and prepared for any potential emergence of old and new viruses because it is our duty to do so. We will work closely with the Ministry of Health (MOH) to take care of our patients in all situations and circumstances, and to ensure best health outcomes for the populations we serve in the Central-North region of Singapore. </p>

                   <p> In other developments, MOH and Woodlands Health (WH) established the first stepped-up Community Care Facility (CCF) in September 2021 by repurposing the NTUC Health Nursing Home in Tampines. The 250-bed CCF provided timely care to patients who were stable, and had mild COVID-19 symptoms but whose underlying conditions or co-morbidities required closer monitoring. Two months later, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) opened a 55-bed COVID-19 Treatment Facility (CTF) at Ren Ci Hospital (CTF@Renci) to care for elderly patients discharged from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) but who still needed close attention. These facilities, in addition to others that opened later, helped augment the nation’s hospital capacity, and ensured better overall management of patient load and specialised care for more critical cases. </p>

                   <P>I am grateful to the medical and nursing teams from these Institutions and others, including Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH), National Skin Centre (NSC), National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGP), and National Healthcare Group (NHG) HQ, who readily stepped up to help redesign care delivery, develop new workflows and clinical management strategies, and provide resources to the facilities. Added support from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), and various General Practitioner (GP) and community partners contributed to our ability to right-site care, without compromising quality and patient safety.  </P>

                    <p> More than two years on, the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us valuable lessons that can further fortify the nation’s capabilities in emergency preparedness, and enhance national resilience. It is important to share the learnings and experiences, and with this in mind, NCID established a Gallery at its premises in September 2021, which showed the journey of our management of severe infectious disease outbreaks, including COVID-19. 
                    </p> 

                    <p>Just as pandemics can be a challenging time for adults, for children, the period of masks and darkness was a confusing period for them too as they tried to make sense of the changes around them. To help the young understand the COVID-19 virus and adapt to endemic times, Professor Leo Yee Sin, Executive Director, NCID, wrote My Coronavirus Story. Supported by NHG and sponsored by the Tanoto Foundation, the picture book conveys the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of a child living during the pandemic. It was launched in December 2021 and is available at most public libraries and primary schools across Singapore. The book is a reference for future generations on public health, vaccination, and emphasises social responsibility in our fight against the virus, and the message of grit, hope, and resilience to gel as a community, and as a nation to combat any battle.</p>

                    <h4> Official Opening of Clinic for Advanced Rehabilitation Therapeutics </h4>

                    <p> 
                    In April 2022, the TTSH Clinic for Advanced Rehabilitation Therapeutics (CART) celebrated its 10th Anniversary and expanded premises, which was graced by Minister for Health Mr Ong Ye Kung. CART offers conventional therapy equipment and state-of-the-art rehabilitative robots to meet the growing demand for such services, helping patients with stroke, brain, and spinal cord injuries in their recovery journey. With its newly expanded premises, CART now offers therapy for those with neurodegenerative disorders and patients recovering from multiple serious injuries.
                    </p> 

                    <p>To enable more patients to gain greater access to innovative technology-enabled rehabilitation, CART inked partnerships with leading rehabilitation care partners: </p> 

                    <p>•   Through a three-year Master Research Collaboration Agreement (RCA) with Fourier Intelligence (FI), CART will make robotic therapies more accessible to patients in the community and will function as a living lab to test-bed and contextualise FI’s technologies to local settings. </p>

                    <p> •   Through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Stroke Support Station (S3), TTSH will refer stable stroke patients to S3 for continued active rehabilitation, wellness activities, and access to a peer support network. This shared care model will allow S3 and TTSH to better co-manage stroke survivors and ensure continued support through their rehabilitative journey. They will also explore tele-collaboration and tele-consultation services.</p>

                    <strong> “What matters to you” Workshop Series </strong>
                    <p> 
                        To reach out to partners in the community, TTSH’s Psychology Department collaborated with the Agency for Integrated Care’s (AIC) Silver Generation Division in July 2021 to launch the “What Matters to you” workshop series, which focused on how to conduct meaningful conversations with seniors on their priorities and engaging them to motivate and influence behavioural change to achieve better health and social outcomes. These workshops used a person-centred approach and leveraged relationship-based care to help seniors lead meaningful and fulfilling lives. Four workshops were conducted for AIC’s Silver Generation Officers (SGOs), and each workshop comprised two half-day sessions. Over 100 SGOs attended the training, and they have since trained other SGOs, and incorporated ‘What Matters’ conversations in the preventive health visits they conduct.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        Together with the Centre for Allied Health & Pharmacy Excellence (CAPE), the Psychology Department also conducted four workshops to train TTSH staff from various disciplines, including the Division of Central Health’s Community Health Team, allied health, nursing, pharmacists, and medical teams, to incorporate “What Matters” conversations into care encounters.

                   <strong>Powering Up People, Charging Up Lives </strong>  

                  <p>TTSH’s Centre of Health Activation (CHA) launched the CHArge Up! Learning Programme in October 2018 to meet the health needs of the local neighbourhoods in Central Singapore. The programme aims to empower carers (patients, caregivers, volunteers, and residents) with the health skills, knowledge and confidence to take charge of their health and, in turn, look after the health of others in the community. </p>

                   <p> To adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic and safe management measures, the programme adopted digital learning in 2020 and conducted virtual sessions to teach carers proper handling of a wheelchair, chronic disease management and staying active. Continual improvements to the programme are made through research evaluation studies and developing new modules. In collaboration with 33 different partners, CHArge Up! has trained over 490 carers to-date, and plans to further expand across the Central Region. </p>

                <strong>Engaging Residents To Build Healthier Communities </strong>

               <P> In May 2022, TTSH’s Centre for Health Activation (CHA) and Kaizen Office engaged residents in Ang Mo Kio for guerilla research, the first session in two years since the COVID-19 pandemic. Themed “Building Healthier Communities”, the research kick-started a year-long quality improvement project aimed at strengthening the community-enabling programmes, aligned with Healthier SG. Residents were invited to identify and discuss specific factors affecting community health and how the community could help shape individual health. The session also raised greater awareness and understanding among the local population of the correlation between individuals and the community in health and social care. The valuable insights gained from the residents will help improve TTSH’s outreach programmes and co-create localised, community-driven solutions, making them more impactful, scalable, and sustainable in the community.</P>

                <p> In recognition of the pivotal roles that volunteers play in supporting the healthcare workforce and the recovery journey of patients, TTSH’s Centre for Health Activation (CHA) organised the annual TTSH & Central Health Volunteer Appreciation Party (VAP) in March 2022. Held virtually, the event appreciated and celebrated the accomplishments of over 100 volunteers and community partners.
